## How to use the GUI

- Open a file using the button that says "Open a file" and navigate to a file (preferably in the HW6 directory)
    - Should be JPG, BMP, PNG, or PPM type
- Use buttons "flip horizontal", "flip vertical", "greyscale", "blur", "sharpen", and "sepia" to edit your image as desired
- For the "brighten" button, first enter a number in the text field below the button (positive to brighten, negative to darken) to specify the increment to change the image by
- For the buttons in the component options, you can only click one to create a greyscale using the specified component
- Use the "reset" button to return to the original image you loaded
- The Image Histogram will update automatically as well as your edited image preview
- Look to the Messages section where it says "Any alerts will show up here" if a command isn't working
- Save a file using the button that says "Save a file" and specify the name and folder to place it in (preferably in the HW6 directory)
- Exit the program by clicking the "Exit" button or pressing the red circle button in the top left corner
- The name your image goes by in the editor will appear next to the "Working image" title in the top left corner in parentheses
